# AWS-Deployment-Configuration-and-Hardening-Cloud-Console
This AWS security project shows that AWS should start at deployment. Hardening the Cloud Console means enforcing least-privilege access, enabling MFA, securing networks, and turning on logging and monitoring. This reduces misconfigurations, limits risk, and keeps cloud environments secure as they scale.
